Here are instructions on how to contribute:

* First read the README.md to understand what is the project.
* There is a development ROADMAP in [GitHub issue #1](https://github.com/PedroHLC/chaotic-installer-qt/issues/1)
* Discuss with [the developer](https://t.me/pedrohlc) what and how things can be done.
* Try to keep it KISS: If it can be done in a simple way, keep it simple. Also, do not add unecessary depencies.
* The projec doesn't have coding style guidelines nor a linter, but keep the code readable and do not add unecessary files to your commits.
* Please use reviewable.io to respond PR's reviews.

Others suggestions:
* To understand the code, start with `src/main.cpp` and `qml/MainContainer.qml`.
